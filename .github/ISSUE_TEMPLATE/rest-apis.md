[ ] I reviewed the API requirements to determine what is needed.
[ ] I designed the routes and methods for each endpoint based on the required functionality.
[ ] I implemented the routes and verified that the responses are valid and meet the expected requirements.
[ ] I followed the REST API URI Naming Conventions and Best Practices (as outlined in doc in confluence)
[ ] I implemented the necessary authentication so that only authenticated users can access the route(s).
[ ] I implemented the required error handling.
[ ] I added satisfactory documentation to Swagger (for example: @ApiParam, ApiOperation, @ApiCreatedResponse, @ApiOkResponse, @ApiNotFoundResponse, @ApiBadRequestResponse)
